Hello everyone! I'm Christian, a student developer living in Tucson, Arizona.

I first fell in love with coding in 2015 through Harvard's [CS50x course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) offered on edX, a massive open online course provider. David J. Malan continues to be a principle inspiration of mine. Since then, I have taken both AP CS courses and, after a year detour in Music Education, landed in the Computer Science program at the University of Arizona, where I'm currently in my third year.

I decided to begin a blog to document my journey and share with anyone who cares to read. I hope that my experiences and knowledge can be helpful to my readers. I have a diverse array of interests, from music and education, to video games and coding.

In this blog, I will be sharing stories from my journey, insights that I discover, and struggles I overcome. In my freetime, I love to experiment with new technologies and develop for the web. This past summer, I set out to learn React and created a few apps using Create React App. Along the way, I read **Learning React: Modern Patterns for Developing React Apps** by Alex Banks and Eve Porcello and I used [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/) to practice. This winter break, I decided to extend my React know-how to developing **this blog** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) as the CMS.

I hope that you join me for my next post, where I will be chronicling my journey to where I am now, and where I want to go.
